Restaurant.find_by(name: "The French Laundry").update(reviews: {review1: "An old stone building laced with ivy houses the most acclaimed restaurant in the Napa Valley—and, indeed, one of the most highly regarded in the country. The two nine-course prix-fixe menus (both $295), one of which highlights vegetables, vary, but 'oysters and pearls,' a silky dish of pearl tapioca with oysters and white sturgeon caviar, is a signature starter. Some courses rely on luxe ingredients like calotte (cap of the rib eye), while others take humble foods such as fava beans and elevate them to art. Many courses also offer the option of 'supplements'—sea urchin, for instance, or black truffles. Reservations are hard-won here; to get one call two months ahead to the day at 10 am, on the dot. ", review2:" This year Thomas Keller is starting a new chapter at his 21-year-old restaurant. He tore down several buildings, and built a replica of the old kitchen in shipping containers to serve as a temporary home while building a permanent kitchen that will be like no other. He gave the international firm Snohetta the challenge of creating a structure inspired by the glass pyramid of the Louvre, to contrast with the elegant dining room that is in a century-old stone building. The new kitchen is scheduled to premiere in November, but in the meantime, chef David Breeden continues to turn out some of the country’s best food on the nine-plus course menu. The expansive garden across the street inspires the nightly changing menu, and no ingredient is repeated. Keller continues to evolve and push the envelope. With Per Se in New York, he is the only American chef to have Michelin three-star restaurants on both coasts. Both are wonderful, and both capture a sense of place."})
Restaurant.find_by(name: "Osteria Francescana").update(reviews: {review1: "Last summer, while on vacation in Italy, my blog’s name took its full meaning when I travelled a few hours out of my way 'just' to have lunch. It wasn’t your ordinary lunch though but quite a memorable one at chef Massimo Bottura’s Osteria Francescana in Modena, a restaurant that has garnered three stars in the esteemed Michelin Guide, ranks third on the San Pellegrino list of The World’s 50 Best Restaurants and has been voted best restaurant in Italy for the past 6 years. I can say without any hesitation that the lunch was worth every extra hour spent on the road to get there. It was one of my most memorable meal of 2014 and I would gladly drive out of my way for another meal there should the opportunity arise.
Osteria Francescana is housed inside a coral-coloured building on a quiet street in the center of Modena. The façade is discreet and the only indication that one has arrived is a small brass sign with the restaurant’s name. Inside is an elegant hall that leads to small dining rooms each holding a handful of tables. The decor is minimal, elegant and discreet with modern art adorning the walls.
Chef Bottura is one of those rare Italian chefs who has managed to put a modern twist on a cuisine that is entrenched in tradition. The menu – adorned with beautiful watercolour illustrations – is divided into three parts: a 'Tradition in Evolution' menu that explores the traditional cuisine of Emilia-Romagna, a 'Classics' menu that lists some of the restaurant’s most renowned dishes and finally, a 'Sensations' menu that hails from Osteria Francesana’s seasonal experimental dishes. For our lunch, the waiter suggested a mix between the classics and the sensations menus and we acquiesced enthusiastically since it allowed us to taste some of the restaurant’s best known plates as well as the latest experimental dishes.
Below are some photo of our sensational lunch. Each plate was like a work of art esthetically but also with regards to the pairing of textures and flavours. Each dish is anchored in its Italian roots but holds the chef’s signature, sense of humour and a desire to reinvent and refine in order to constantly evolve. The Caesar salad below for example, contains 22 ingredients hidden in its buttery leaves; twenty-two tiny bursts of concentrated flavour including classic Caesar ingredients like Parmesan cheese, crisp bread, pancetta and vinegar.
One of my favourite dishes of the lunch was the fantastic play on Parmigiano Reggiano, one of Emilia-Romagna’s most famous products. The cheese is transformed into a foam, a mousse, a soufflé, a cream and a crisp using Parmigiano cheeses that have been aged anywhere between 25 and 50  months. Another favourite dish was the foie gras crunch, a classic Bottura dish that’s been on the menu for a few years and for good reason: it is absolutely exquisite! The acidity of the Traditional Balsamic Vinegar from Modena that oozes out when one bites into the pre-dessert cuts through the richness of the foie gras to create a perfect balance between sweet and savoury and an ideal bridge towards the sweeter courses of the meal.
Enjoy the photo and make sure to detour through Modena the  next time you’re in Italy! ", review2:" This restaurant is a step above the rest with its well-balanced menu and ability to create innovative versions of traditional recipes. This is thanks to a critical and non-nostalgic approach and a focus on light cuisine. The Osteria Francescana has consolidated its position as one of Italy's leading restaurants, with a talented chef whose reputation is truly international."})
Restaurant.find_by(name: "Blue Hill Restaurant").update(reviews: {review1: "Halfway through dinner at Blue Hill, my server presented me with two squashes. One was the common football-size butternut that weighs down shopping bags at this time of year. The other had the same shape but was about as big as a sparrow. I held it in my palm. It felt good in there. Without thinking about what I was doing, I began petting it. The couple at the next table asked if they could see my tiny squash, and I let them stroke its smooth, cool skin. Before things got too weird, our server took my pet squash back to the kitchen.
When it came back, it had been roasted and cut in half. Specks of white pepper and strands of grated chestnut lay against its dark orange insides. It was sweeter than a normal butternut, but what I mostly noticed was that it tasted squashier, as if all the flavor had been compressed. Selective breeding was responsible, our server explained. Dan Barber, Blue Hill’s executive chef and a co-owner with his brother, David, had asked a Cornell agriculture professor to design a squash for him, making it as small and tasty as possible. The result is the 898 squash, served exclusively at Mr. Barber’s two restaurants, Blue Hill at Stone Barns in Pocantico Hills, N.Y., and this one, just off Washington Square Park.
Mr. Barber opened the one in Manhattan first, in 2000, with the idea of using local seasonal produce, including some from his family’s farm in the Berkshires. This put him in the company of, oh, several hundred other chefs. A few years later, though, he was chosen to lead an ambitious project at Stone Barns that combined a farm and a restaurant with research and education programs.
It turned out that he was born for the job. Patient, intense, curious, enthusiastic, articulate, Mr. Barber has become a dirt poet and kitchen philosopher whose time outside with the pigs and the beans has had a deep, lasting effect on the way he cooks. Today no other chef has the information he keeps in his head (how to make pure carbon out of a cow’s femur) or the vegetables he puts in his ovens (sparrow-size squash).
To get the Full Barber, you have to go to Stone Barns for a $198 menu-free, open-ended meal that may include, if you’re lucky, a tour of the manure shed where hot compost is put to work as cooking fuel. The original Blue Hill sits in the English basement of a townhouse in Greenwich Village, a historically tolerant neighborhood whose tolerance does not extend to manure sheds. The city doesn’t afford the time or space for the leisurely unfurling of Mr. Barber’s complete vision of how our appetites should fit into the land and the climate. The low-ceilinged space is too much like a saloon, the tables too close together, the restaurant’s many ardent admirers too accustomed to treating it as a place to catch up over an excellent weeknight dinner.
If Blue Hill had as many cooks and servers as its more favored sister upstate, they would probably iron out wrinkles like the long, stranded layovers between courses; the wineglasses that sat empty and were finally cleared with no offer of fresh ones; and the $23 glass of Rully poured ice-cold, so it was clenched and astringent. It also seems far out of character that this intensely local restaurant sells just two New York wines on its Francophilic (and not very value-minded) list, and that its only cider comes from California when there is a cider revival going on in Mr. Barber’s own, apple-rich state.But while it may give you only a Half Barber, Blue Hill is still an exceptional restaurant. Mr. Barber’s long search for flavor out of town pays off downtown, where you find yourself thinking, again and again, that each new ingredient may well be the best example of its kind you’ve ever tasted. For this reason and others, Blue Hill is one of the few New York restaurants that seem to get better and more original as time goes by. This was true the last time it was reviewed in The New York Times, in 2006, when Frank Bruni brought it from two stars to three, and it is true now.Dinner at Blue Hill can go in one of two directions: a four-course, $85 menu that you choose, or a longer, free-form 'farmer’s feast' chosen by Mr. Barber or his chef de cuisine, Shingoon Hong, for $98 or $125, depending on how hungry the farmer is. Either way, the night will include a couple of surprise cameos by fruits and vegetables that drop in like the kooky neighbors in a sitcom.A meal in September started with wispy young fennel stalks that had a clean and pure licorice sweetness and ended with firm, green-skinned, yellow-fleshed plums on ice. Both made me happy I had come to Blue Hill then, not a week sooner or later, which is the effect that certain fruits and vegetables can have when they’re picked at the right time. In a more recent meal, the kitchen sent out a raw hakurei turnip as big as an apple. In fact, it had been pushed through an apple slicer. I picked up a white wedge, swiped it through a pool of tarragon vinaigrette and braced for the harsh turnip aftertaste that never came. I won’t tell you that I ate the whole thing, or that it was as sweet and juicy as an apple, but it came much closer than I would have thought possible.When it comes to actual cooking, Mr. Barber’s approach is to intensify ingredients that are pretty intense already. Looking at the saturated orange color of fat slabs of roasted carrot 'cutlet,' I could tell it was going to taste richer and rounder than any carrot I had met before. The approach works on things that once had a pulse, too. Grass-fed, dry-aged veal, carved into a sampler of cuts, some fattier, some leaner, was ruddier and more bloody-tasting than most veal, but it still had a focused, refined taste that set it apart from beef. The caramelized outside edge of a slowly roasted neck from a Blue Hill Farm goat had a profoundly satisfying chew; the meat hiding under it was astoundingly tender and juicy. It had some of the primal pleasures of barbecue, and I wanted to tear into it with my hands.
In the early days of Blue Hill, I respected the cooking but didn’t want to wallow around in it the way I do now. The whole complicated web that Mr. Barber oversees has many purposes, spinning off in all directions, but if you just sit down to dinner, you can believe that the point of the entire operation is to provide you with one delicious taste after another. And maybe it is. ", review2:" Defining the 'farm-to-table ethos', this 'intimate' Village American is a shrine to 'spectacular' seasonal dining where 'ultrafresh' ingredients and “loving preparation' yield 'nuanced' cuisine 'that excites'; overseen by an ever-'hospitable' staff, it’s a definite 'splurge', but also an “utterly unforgettable experience.'"})
Restaurant.find_by(name: "El Restaurante Patagonia Sur").update(reviews: {review1: "Restaurateur and Chef José Francisco Mallmann or simply Francis Mallmann is Argentina’s most famous chef and has been renowned for his expertise in cooking with fire, but started his career at young age by cooking French haute cuisine. He eventually became tired of serving wealthy Argentineans fancy French food, according to himself, so he turned back to his Patagonian roots to become recognised as the master of the grill and cooking based on simplicity.
Francis Mallmann has several restaurants and his Buenos Aires venue is located in the working class neighbourhood of La Boca. The area is not known for its restaurants, but the location once was the home of Chef Mallmann and it still feels like entering someone’s private home when you enter the restaurant. The main entrance door may be locked even at lunch time due to the area the restaurant is located in, which is not too safe and you should be on the alert on your way to the restaurant during evening time in particular. The restaurant was remodelled by architect Pablo Sánchez Elia and interior architect Laura Orcoyen in 1999 and the style of the restaurant is still the same. The Italian townhouse is originally from the nineteen twenties and works perfect as the setting for Mallmann’s cuisine.
100 percent Argentinean cuisine is what you will have and a lot of it originating from Patagonia far south of Buenos Aires. You will probably not find Francis Mallmann in the kitchen, but his team executes his cooking techniques almost flawlessly so expect a lot of signature dishes like the rib eye with chimichurri and Patagonia potatoes, empanada from the wine region of Mendoza and the delicious seven and half hours lamb with mashed potatoes, arugula and almonds.
Francis Mallmann started his cooking career in the nineteen seventies and since then he has established several restaurants. His original domains in Argentina and in the neighbouring Uruguay have expanded and the Restaurateur and Chef flies frequently between his restaurants which may affect the quality of the cuisine. There are many fantastic talents when it comes to open fire cooking, but Francis Mallmann is the most famous of them all in Argentina and you would like to have him in the kitchen during your meal and not just hear about his name. ", review2:" After an all-night flight on my way to Salta, Argentina, I had a five hour layover at the Buenos Aires airport. Continuing my pursuit to visit all of restauranteur Francis Mallman's incredible restaurants, I took a car into the city to have lunch at his famous restaurant Patagonia Sur in BA’s colorful La Boca neighborhood, then head back to the airport. I asked my travel agent to make a reservation and when I got there they unlocked the door and let me in. There was no one there but the extremely nice waiter. I asked 'Where is everybody?' and he replied: 'We’re normally not open for lunch, but you had made a reservation so we opened up for you.' Incredible.
It was just me and the patient waiter, with me giggling and pounding the table as I took my first bite of each course. I can only imagine what it’s like with people. Pinch me."})
Restaurant.find_by(name: "N/Naka").update(reviews: {review1: "Kaiseki, the Japanese formal, multicourse style of dining that emphasizes seasonality, has its Western cousins, certainly, in the tasting menus of high-end European and American restaurants. Yet kaiseki is a different beast: rooted in tradition and formality but open to interpretation. It is less about pure hedonism and more about ritual. It's about eating as a way of understanding the passing of time — both the time it takes you to dine and the seasons that make the meal possible.
At n/naka, chef Niki Nakayama presents a modern interpretation of kaiseki, though not too modern. The ceremony, the carefully calibrated order of dishes, the tradition of using the materials at hand carefully and wisely — all of these are alive and well at n/naka.
A native Angeleno, Nakayama began her cooking career at Takao in Brentwood. Seeking to further her understanding of Japanese cooking and technique, she then spent three years traveling around Japan working in different kitchens, including a Japanese country inn, or ryokan, owned by some relatives. There, she trained specifically in kaiseki.
Upon her return to L.A., Nakayama first opened a sushi restaurant in West Hollywood, Azami Sushi Cafe, which was known for its all-female staff. But later at n/naka, which opened on an unremarkable stretch of Overland Avenue in Palms in the spring of 2011, she committed herself to delivering the full kaiseki experience. To bring the tradition's seasonal underpinnings closer, Nakayama had an organic garden built; she draws on it to create her menus.
The experience of dining at n/naka is almost solemn in its formality. Reservations must be held with a credit card, and if you book online, you'll get a call a few days in advance to see which menu you'd prefer: There are two options, nine or 13 courses, plus a vegetarian offering. Suffice it to say none of these is a good option for a quick meal — you're looking at more than two hours for even the shorter service.
The restaurant is housed in a severe, gray, modern building that has no sign and looks very much like a foreboding office of some sort, perhaps housing a dentist's practice, or a tax lawyer. When you arrive and push through the large wooden door, servers will greet you by name. The rooms are spare, with little to distract you from the rhythm of the meal. Dishes are presented with soft-spoken and detailed explanations, like little hunger-inducing bedtime stories.
Despite all this, the restaurant manages to feel comfortable and friendly. The Japanese penchant for austerity certainly guides the emotional foundation of the restaurant, and even most of the food. But there's lightness and camaraderie and beauty in that austerity.
And so a meal unfolds, in quiet stanzas: A blue shrimp, split open and grilled to its buoyant, juicy ideal and coated with yuzu cream; a modern interpretation of a sashimi course involving otoro, scallions and a tiny sliver of mildly sweet butter flavored with uni; a plate of lovingly arranged sashimi offerings, including tai (sea bream), kanpachi and one perfect Kumamoto oyster with ponzu and lemon.
Eventually, after a steamed dish and a grilled dish (often presented with a personal, flaming, cast-iron hibachi, so that you can grill the evening's selections to your preference), you will arrive at the shiizakana course, described as the 'chef's choice, not bound by tradition.' For this course, n/naka usually serves a dish that has become Nakayama's signature: spaghettini with black abalone, pickled cod roe and Italian summer truffles. It's a wild dish, the line of the poem that smacks and then soothes you, the one that elevates the meal beyond careful and impressive adherence to custom and turns it into something singular. The perfume of the truffle, the dueling types of textural resistance of the abalone and the pasta, the light acidity of the pickled roe builds to something astounding, one of the most memorable dishes I've had all year.
From there, you move on to a meat course, a lovely medium-rare slice of beef — usually rib-eye — presented with seasonal vegetables, perhaps a puree of lunar carrots from the chef's garden and a sprig of broccolini. As well-executed as it is, this dish proved the least interesting to me — more like the fussed-over food you might find at a standard high-end hotel restaurant than the subtle revelations of the rest of the menu.
Then, a flurry of sushi, pieces brought out two at a time, the fish gleaming, the rice the comforting temperature of a sunny day. As you finish off your meal, with a low bowl of vibrant green matcha tea to help you digest, and a green tea chocolate cake alongside a black sesame creme brulee, you may find that the rhythm of the meal has gotten into your bones.
With their soothing demeanor and attention to detail, the servers here are an extension of Nakayama's vision. About one-third of the way into my most recent meal, my waiter realized I had dined at the restaurant not too long before. Rather than the usual, 'Good to see you again, thanks for coming back,' he seemed quietly concerned, and when he returned to the table, he discreetly asked me if I knew the date of my previous visit, as he understood the reservation name had been different. I realized that he was going back and looking at the menu I had eaten before, because the chef did not want me to repeat any dishes I'd had on my previous visit. And when Nakayama came to the table at the end of the meal (which she does for every table), she apologized: Had they known I was returning, they wouldn't have repeated any dishes. I was stunned — in the 10-plus courses I'd been served, only three were familiar. The idea that Nakayama might rewrite the complex poem of kaiseki for one diner is astonishing.
Almost everything Nakayama is doing at n/naka is astonishing, in fact. For such a small operation to create such a perfectly calibrated, complex experience shows a level of dedication that's more than uncommon — it's extraordinary. There are more exciting dining options in town, ones with a louder story to tell. But for the quiet poetry of seasonality and reflection, n/naka is unparalleled. ", review2:" 'A feast for the eyes' and the 'gourmet' palate, the 'modern' Japanese multicourse kaiseki meals at this Palms 'ultimate experience' – rated No. 1 for Food in Los Angeles – consist of an 'incredible sequence' of 'intricate', 'exquisite' dishes, all displaying the 'delicate mastery' of 'genius' chef Niki Nakayama; 'lovely, serene' surroundings and 'intimate, leisurely' service complete the 'magnificent' (and 'pricey') picture – just know that 'reservations require months of lead time', as 'the secret is out.'"})
Restaurant.find_by(name: "Attica").update(reviews: {review1: "How much Australian wildlife will I eat? Quite a bit, as it happens. Lamb, chicken, pork and beef haven’t made major appearances on the Attica menu for some time now, but those interested in the macropod family will be pleased to see not just wallaby blood in the pikelets (think a sort of tea-time version of blini) but also salted raw red kangaroo with native bunya bunya nuts and purple carrot in the signature dish. Emu has been known to put in an appearance and marron, the large, sweet native crayfish, is a mainstay.
And to drink? It’s no less an adventure in the glass, with pairings hopping from Tasmanian sour beer to serious skin-contact from South Australia to unpasteurised sake and back again.
What about Australian culture? References to Aussie culture and history are threaded throughout Attica’s menus, some of them more subtly than others, whether it’s in the form of 'Gazza’s Vegemite pie,' wattleseed bread, halftime oranges or the Anzac marshmallow that closes proceedings.
Did you know? Ben Shewry, the humble but brilliant chef behind Attica, actually hails from New Zealand originally. ", review2:" Attica is ‘experience dining’ but the experience is not about the venue or a celebrity chef – it is all about the food. The service is exquisite, the staff are helpful and knowledgeable with no hint of condescension ... but the food … oh, the food!
Even the bread at the start of the meal is incredible. It comes with a delicious macadamia nut dip and the very best butter you’ve ever had, and thankfully it’s so good the staff don’t judge you when you say yes to a third serving.
The appetisers are ridiculous – I still do not understand how something so small can taste so big. The meal has an Antipodean undercurrent running through it without the naffness of the term 'modern Australian'. One in every few dishes has a native ingredient that you’ve never heard of but then want to be a part of your life forever.
I honestly didn’t know how each course would better the last but the flavours were so engaging and playful on each dish and the pacing is so well planned that each course is a delight, and you never feel rushed or full (see three servings of bread above).
My favourite dish, Ten Flavours of St Joseph’s Wort, rendered me into a hysterical state. I still dream about those mouthfuls. It is so seemingly simple – tomatoes and ten types of basil – yet with flavours so complex that the dish becomes a moment.
For a vegetarian who often feels neglected when eating out in Australia, having a full eight courses where each dish is as beautifully constructed as anything my meat-eating friend was served, if not better, was a cherry on top of what will be known as the best meal of my life.
Yes, you do need to book a few months in advance and it is an awful lot to spend on one meal but goodness is it worth every cent and more.
You need to commit to a full evening of dining. Our entire Attica experience was a little over five hours and be prepared for the harshness of reality when the night ends and you’re sitting on a tram next to someone eating a burger out of a brown paper bag and even more so when the next morning when you’re back to Vegemite toast with something not quite resembling the butter you know exists at Attica."})
Restaurant.find_by(name: "Fäviken").update(reviews: {review1: "From northern Sweden, 31-year-old Magnus Nilsson has dedicated his life to cooking. As a child he would hunt and forage in the forests that surrounded his grandparents’ 50-acre farm; at 16 he attended culinary school; by 19, he was working in Pascal Barbot’s Michelin-starred restaurant l’Astrance in Paris. He remembers, in his mid-teens, writing a 20-year plan that culminated with him running the world’s best restaurant.
With a few years to go, some critics say he has achieved that aim already; a broader consensus is that his 12-cover premises, Faviken Magasinet, is the world’s most isolated (and as a result some say exclusive) gourmet restaurant.
Faviken stands on a 20,000-acre hunting estate and nature reserve in Jamtland, a Swedish province that shares the same latitude as Iceland and is the same size as the Benelux region but which is home to 125,000 people rather than the latter’s 28 million.
For gourmands more accustomed to the continent’s gold-plated Michelin-starred restaurants, Faviken’s interior must seem astonishing in its paucity. Save the addition of a zinc-topped bar, the building looks the same as it did when built in 1745. Each pine beam (some still faintly showing ancient handwritten records of grain stock levels) and floorboard is original; chairs are draped in lamb skins; slabs of meat, atrophied fish and crisped bouquets of herbs and tobacco leaves hang from the walls and ceilings. One candle burns on each of the five pine tables.
There’s little time to focus on surroundings, though; as soon as you have a drink in hand food hits you like an assault. Our group was told to expect 'a 20-course menu, 30 or so if you count the additional bits and pieces we serve before, during and after the main meal'. While we chatted at the bar, gutsy snacks came fast: first flaxseed and vinegar crisps with a salty mussel dip, then wild trout’s roe served in a crust of dried pig’s blood; later deep-fried pig’s head dipped in sourdough and slivers of salted herring that had been aged for three years.
A brief reprieve at 7.30pm, when we were escorted to our tables and poured a glass of Faviken’s own mead, before the volley resumed, to continue unremittingly for hours. Cooked over burning juniper berries, scallops the size of burgers arrived swimming in their own juices; boiled trout came with an earthy lichen-lined 'bog butter' that had been buried in peat; injected with beer, cockles gushed flavour when chewed; a rare dud, blood bread, moose broth, backfat and onions was less appetising than it sounds; colostrum – the first milk a cow produces after giving birth – was served with blueberries as a yoghurt and, later, an egg yolk preserved in sugar syrup arrived on a bed of pine-tree bark crumbs and a spruce ice cream. It tasted like a mouthful of forest.
Finally finished, we were led to the bar for tea, homemade liquers and Faviken-style petit fours – think tar pastilles and beeswax-coated anise seeds rather than pralines. With time to reflect now and social restraint blunted by booze, our group dissected the experience. Even among the best-fed, there had been flavours, textures and cooking methods that were unprecedented; for all their novelty and ingenuity, dishes were largely simple, unaffected and tasty. And for most of us, Faviken’s peerless confluence of improbable setting, unique dishes and the castaway romance of a chef who left the world behind only for it follow him elevated our dinner into 'most memorable meal ever' territory.
", review2:"  The original plan was to do it all in one night. Starting with a 7am flight from Heathrow (which means a 4am alarm). Given that the whole point of a trip to Faviken was dinner, there seemed little point: I'd be off balance by late afternoon, experiencing auditory hallucinations while sipping the locally brewed beer in Faviken's sauna, and face-down in the blood bread and moose broth mid-supper. So instead, I flew to Stockholm a day before heading to the snowbound northern landscape of Jamtland, for some complementary dining and a lie-in. In for a penny, in for a krona...
Faviken's dining room has 12 seats and can be as difficult to book as it is arduous to get to (although the waiting list, and the just-launched Gatelag Table, serving more traditional dishes, are worth considering). It's on many a foodie's bucket list, and has been on mine ever since chef Magnus Nilsson's cookbook appeared on my kitchen bookshelf. Black grouse, reindeer lichen and cloudberries are in short supply around Stoke Newington in north London, so I'd always approached Faviken as more of a storybook than a source of dinner-party menu planning.
But the Scandinavian, and specifically Swedish, approach to all things contemporary and culinary has impressed me for the best part of a decade. Up there with Eleven Madison Park in Manhattan, Arzak in San Sebastián and L'enclume in the Lake District, one of my top five meals of all time was at Mathias Dahlgren's Matsalen, at the Grand Hotel in Stockholm, shortly after it opened. Dahlgren weaves a personal narrative that involves Proustian memories of childhood meals, around the logistics of local, premium produce. The night before flying north to Ostersund for Faviken, I booked one of the 10 stools at Dahlgren's new Matbordet – a chef's counter table, in a glass box on the side of the fine-dining room. Chef Oskar Petterson created several courses of Swedish Christmas-themed dishes in front of us, with detailed narration and a modern twist: lush pickled herring, smoked salmon with roe, pork belly with trotter dumplings, and festive spiced breads.
'Matbordet is about predicting the future of dining,' Dahlgren told me, shortly before service. 'People are now as interested in what's going on off the plate as they are on the plate. The meaning of luxury has changed.'
Europe's most remote fine-dining experience
Fine dining has, definitely, become less passive as diners become more inquisitive. Even dinner at the rarefied Matsalen begins with a journey into the kitchen to have a nose around before diners take their seats in front of their iPad menus.
The Grand Hotel is still the only game in town when it comes to lavish, grande dame, marble bathtub, crystal chandelier and Chinoiserie wallpaper luxury. From its position on the water to the way the staff lower the exterior shades at breakfast, inch by inch, until the glare of the morning sun is off the last diner's face, it's a near-perfect luxury hotel. But I was also keen to try out the nearby Hotel Skeppsholmen, on the island of the same name. It's in one of the landmark buildings close to the Moderna Museet and Arkitekturmuseet, in a part of the city so pretty that not even Niki de St Phalle's maddeningly trite sculptures can spoil it.
I loved Skeppsholmen's super-modern-but-still-candlelit breakfast room, but wasn't so keen on the entirely translucent bathroom/toilet doors in the bedrooms. My eyes! My precious eyes!
The next day, after an hour's flight into snowier climes, I am in Ostersund, where I meet local foodie Fia Gulliksson. She runs the Jazzkoket restaurant, which specialises in sustainable and regional ingredients, as well as having her own radio show, running a company producing teas, and, as CEO of Food in Action, is behind a move to have Unesco label the town a City of Gastronomy. 'We need people to know what treasure there is here,' she says, as we tuck into clove buns and carrot bread at the Frejas Bakeri. 'The farms around here are all largely organic. The produce is incredible.'
The produce of Jamtland county is what motivated Magnus Nilsson – who was an apprentice chef at 14 – to open Faviken, around an hour's drive north west of Ostersund. His roots are deep here, in a region that has its own language – more akin to Icelandic than Swedish. It also has its own distinct agriculture, encompassing Sami-style foraging and hunting.
Faviken isn't just a restaurant, it's also a hunting estate. If you think there's a profit margin in a 12-cover restaurant in an old barn, 200 miles south of the Arctic Circle, that's closed for 20 weeks of the year, then you have scant understanding of the business. A night costs more than £500 before flights, but as life experiences go it's definitely worth it. And it's the very definition of what Dahlgren means by the new kind of luxury.
After unwinding in the sauna – complete with bar and charcuterie – the evening's guests assemble in the candlelit 18th-century barn at 7pm for rhubarb wine and amuse bouche. There's a bust of Socrates (looking like a bearded sibling of Magnus's) above the open fire, next to an axe and hand mincer, and a bookshelf with a copy of Australian chef Ben Shewry's Origin. In case any of us have somehow forgotten the temperature and landscape outside, there's a ton-weight of ankle-length, two-century old wolf-fur coat hanging on the wall, like a lupine Joseph Beuys installation.
We have multiple courses downstairs, including flaxseed and vinegar crisps and pig's head, dipped in sourdough and deep-fried into little balls, with pickled gooseberry. A salted herring – aged for three years – is deconstructed into small bites. Major effort has gone into ensuring the stripes of fat on slices of cured pork are even and symmetrical. It all looks beautiful, tastes marvellous, and everyone's excited: the Norwegian couple next to me are on a belated honeymoon. But no one is on Instagram or Twitter. 'Only politicians and comedians do that in Sweden,' someone says.
For the first of the main courses – the biggest and most succulent scallop I have ever encountered, cooked over juniper branches and served in broth in its own shell, accompanied by honey-rich mead – we are led upstairs. It's arrestingly sparse. Just three tables are set. Slabs of meat hang from the rafters, like the carnivorous elements of a Francis Bacon canvas. It's theatrical – a little bit Amish, a little bit Evil Dead, but also cosy and chic. Staff prepare dishes in the shadows, in matching grey smocks, suggesting some kind of rite as much as supper, and each new dish is introduced by two sharp claps of a chef's hands.
Dinner at Faviken is never ess assault on my taste buds has driven me from the table overwhelmed, succumbed, surrendered, my hands and legs shaking, and we are 'only' around 30 courses in. I have licked my plate of 'gazpacho' and 'ajo blanco', oblivious to my more reserved, more refined companions. I have tasted five of Geoffroy's dazzling Dom Pérignons, but I need respite before the two hare dishes, the 'game meat cappuccino', the 'blood', the 'pond', the donuts, the other desserts and the 'box'."})

", review2:" Neutral gray and very discreet, Atelier Crenn is almost camouflaged in plain sight. Inside, gracious servers keep the dining room low key and very serene. The décor follows suit with a ceiling comprised of a backlit reed canopy, twig-like fixtures, and unadorned wood tables. This is a place for celebrants as well as serious foodies. Warm and very competent servers explain dishes with the same painstaking detail and dexterity that the kitchen uses to place carrot jerky onto its mossy twig. Chef Dominique Crenn's cooking is at once whimsical and deeply accomplished, based on elemental expressions of the earth or sea. While the idea of 'poetic culinaria' may seem self-indulgent to some, this cuisine is undeniably authentic, deeply personal, and filled with brilliant grace notes of flavor and creativity. Expect dishes that are light yet complex, such as fluke that seems ready to melt over tarragon ice, amid droplets of creamy smoked sturgeon, sea-cucumber dashi, and pickled Asian pears. Dark and intense spot prawn broth is so deeply flavored that it seems like you are tasting shellfish for the first time. A trio of aloe gelée, purée, and snow is incomparably refreshing and herbaceous."})
Restaurant.find_by(name: "Pujol").update(reviews: {review1: "What makes it special: Celebrity chef-owner Enrique Olvera has taken Mexican food – from street to haute cuisine – and given it his own unique treatment. Using everything from chicatana flying ants to octopus and suckling pig, he brings out all the wonderful flavours of Mexico in fresh and sophisticated ways.
How it works: Diners at Pujol are given a daily menu that includes snacks for all, then a choice between items for the next six courses. Highlights include the barbacoa lamb taco, which oozes juicy barbecued flavour, and the egg ‘infladita’ with grasshopper sauce. The signature Happy Ending dessert includes a spiral of churros with chocolate dipping sauce and a selection of small sweet treats.
Must-try dishes: Pujol’s signature is the Mole Madre, Mole Nuevo: a plate with a perfect circle of fresh mole sauce encased in an outer layer of mole that has been aged for – at latest count – almost 1,000 days. The contrasting flavours of the two moles make for a fascinating delve into the magic of Mexican cuisine.
To drink: Olvera celebrates all things Mexican and the drinks menu is no different: there’s an extensive range of mescal and agave spirits as well as local and international wines, and non-alcoholic options also include the refreshing aguas frescas with mint and cucumber.
", review2:"  The subtly lit interior is like a fine suit: understated and elegant, with starched napery, navy walls, and a few silver accessories. Service is hushed and artful. Indeed, the setting and the staff completely recede during the meal so you can focus on the food. Internationally acclaimed chef Enrique Olvera continuously reinvents traditional Mexican dishes and their presentation, and is largely responsible for the country's gastronomic revolution. For locals as well as tourists, the experience can be as educational as it is hedonistic, and the menus are prix fixe only to create a holistic flavor experience—skip one dish and you'd feel as if something were missing. The tableware complements the food: a simple white plate to show off coloration, a beakerlike vessel to display a layered creation, a lidded gourd with traditional carvings to hold an equally traditional soup. Despite the tailored setting and haute cuisine, Pujol is a dressy-casual place; reservations aren't required, but really are a good idea. Bringing children under 12 is discouraged."})

The internationally awarded chef, Ana, makes use of homegrown vegetables and fresh trout from the nearby alpine-water creek with rare inventiveness and skill. Also boasting great service, a first-class wine cellar, and a cheese cellar, in which the owner produces his own cheese, this restaurant is a must. ", review2:" Hiša (= house) Franko, with its unique, rather local and very seasonal philosophy has been a prominent member of the Slovenian culinary world for years. The wine cellar, hidden beneath a herb garden, offers a rich selection of mainly Slovenian wines, including some rare ones. The heart of Hiša Franko is the cheese cellar, where local Slovenian cheeses, particularly from the area of Tolmin, are slowly ageing. You will be served in a beautiful environment: in a wonderful garden in the summer or otherwise in a nicely renovated house from 1867. A must for all the food lovers out there!
A hundred years old lime tree avenue, which winds through the valley under the summits of the mighty Matajur, Krn and Kobariški Stol, leads us from Kobarid to Hiša Franko. Once a mill and a wayside inn, a hospital during World War I, in which (legend says it) even Ernest Hemingway was treated, today a House that offers unusual culinary goods and comfortable accommodation.
The owners, Ana and Valter, complement each other and add their part to the story of Hiša Franko. Ana is in charge of the restaurant, which offers very personal, light, seasonal and locally oriented food. With a unique signature. They think and buy locally, encouraging the local environment to preserve tradition and autochthonism. From small cattle, topinambour (I believe you are wondering what that is, too), dairy products, trout, through the ‘it is worth picking up’ walnuts, hazelnuts, chestnuts, wild herbs, flowers and herbs mentality. With this in mind, Valter created a wine and cheese cellar deep below their herb garden. The cheese cellar is dedicated to 'Tolminec', one of the three autochthon Slovenian cheeses. With the right degree of humidity and the adequate temperature the cheeses mature through the years into a real (and for many undiscovered) culinary gem. There are mainly Slovenian wines in the wine cellar, including some rare ones, and the selection of champagnes is interesting as well.

Restaurant.find_by(name: "El Bulli").update(reviews: {review1: "I am still not sure why El Bulli made me cry. Or at least how it magicked a hot tear to my eye. It wasn't the intensity of taste, with shifting textures and notes that lasted longer than Pavarotti's C. It wasn't that I felt I had to close my eyes in a crowded room to savour and surf every wave of flavour. It wasn't even that 'peas 2011' tasted more like my first peas than in any dish I've eaten since I was seven. Nor was it, honestly, the toasty flow of Dom Pérignon 1973. It was simply, in the end, I think, the deliciousness that undid me.
Not all the dishes were sublime, of course – I am not sure chef Ferran Adrià is interested in that. He wants to make you think and to feel food, to orchestrate your mood, mess with your idea of what it could and should be. More flavour theatre than restaurant. We ate a Felliniesque, insane 50 dishes culled from Adrià's 'greatest hits', the oldest from more than 20 years before, the newest only finalised that morning (the menu was revised six times). Plus endless choices from a giant chocolate box that looked like a flashing organ coming out of the floor. But if we pass over the Japanese-style tiramisu (a sleight of hand with miso that was plain unpleasant), the disappointing trademark carbonara tagliatelle, and the 'challenging' frozen gorgonzola balloon, El Bulli's 50 cooks still sent out close to 50 plates of food for 50 people that no other restaurant may ever match. As Ferran Adrià's heir apparent and current number one cook in the world, René Redzepi of Copenhagen's Noma, tells me: 'Ferran and his team are culinary freedom fighters. They helped free me.'
Our superluxe Spanish food trip started, surreally, in Luton, in an anonymous single-storey airport building where celebrities and top business people avoid civilians and waiting for flights. We had just missed Ozzy Osbourne shuffling though the lounge, and then Simon le Bon suddenly couldn't come. But 30 minutes before takeoff on our private jet – like a top-end Lexus limo with wings – actress Rosamund Pike has heroically stepped in for the year's hot meal ticket: an El Bulli supper, pitch perfect for a selection of rare champagne, devised by Adrià with Richard Geoffroy, Dom Pérignon's effervescent chef de cave.
Later that day, over dinner in a private Catalan castle, I am sitting opposite Hollywood's Heather Graham and Jason Silva, her film-producer boyfriend, who have also flown in for the feast, watching as the star of Boogie Nights and The Hangover delicately transfers her food from her plate to her partner's. While the rest of us gorge on octopus, Iberico ham and vintage fizz, she is saved from starvation by a strawberry kebab.
But the star everyone is here to see is Ferran Adrià, the 'best cook on the planet', according to Joël Robuchon, and he should know, with his world-record 26 Michelin stars.
'I never said I wouldn't feed people,' Adrià smiles when I ask what he will miss when he closes his door at the end of this, his last season. 'After July, El Bulli won't be a restaurant, not open every day. But I will still need feedback.' Adrià's plan is for a nonprofit centre for 'culinary creativity' opening in 2014, with a stream of new recipes posted on the internet. 'We are excited,' he says through an interpreter (Adrià doesn't trust his English to be precise enough for our purposes). 'Bulli has always been about change. Why does Madonna with all her money need to earn more? She could share, not her money but her creativity. The young share, and we at the top should, too.
'When we started there were eight of us, all bachelors; now we have families, kids. I don't have children but I am very happily married, with a wonderful wife. With the foundation I can give something back – my talent, my luck. I have created 1,846 dishes – 80 per cent of new cookery techniques come from here – but no one can be number one for ever. Even those that love us get tired' – though this may be news to the two million people who desperately tried to book when the news of El Bulli's closure was announced.
'I will be 50 soon, with maybe 25-30 years left,' he laughs. 'I want to be happy like I have always been, and I can do this  by taking away the things I don't like. Do what I want, when I want, for who I want.'
I head into the El Bulli kitchen in time to catch the team troop in at 1pm, seven hours before service: heads bowed, hushed, intent. More like medieval novices come to mass than chefs about to prepare perhaps the greatest avant-garde meal ever seen.
Mateu Casañas, who has been with Adrià for 12 years, talks me through the preparation. Quietly, the chefs split into smaller teams. Ten start by teasing the germ from pine kernels, another six grade peas and skin them; 12 extract translucent filaments from sea cucumber to be intricately, delicately, lined into squares; four more sort papery yellow roses for perfect petals to be stuffed and steamed like dim sum. Seamlessly and almost silently, they shift between jobs, splitting young almonds to extract a jelly, making 'parmesan frozen air'.
I talk to Francesca, a Canadian of Asian heritage. On the day the call came from El Bulli she had been offered a staff position at Thomas Keller's three-star Per Se in New York. 'So did I take a paid job in New York,' she smiles, 'or another 'stage' in Spain where I didn't speak the language?' And yet here she is in her second unpaid season, frothing and freezing buckets of cheese foam with a large grin on her face.
Jason Atherton also worked a stage at El Bulli, in 1998 when he was 27 – the year Adrià created his first foam. Before my trip to El Bulli we talk in the bar at Pollen Street Social, the British chef's celebrated new place in Mayfair. 'I had worked with great chefs before,' he says, 'Marco Pierre White, Nico Ladenis, Pierre Koffmann, but it was from Ferran I learnt to question everything.'
It took a full three years, says Atherton, before he realised how much his time at El Bulli had changed him: 'There were 40 of us at the start of the season and at the end there were only 20 left. It takes a lot out of you, but the principles of how to run a great restaurant stay: the system, the time clock, the attention to detail. If I hadn't learn that, I wouldn't be here today.
'The sangria foam I serve at Pollen Street is the exact recipe I learnt, 12 years on. It is the lightest, airiest sangria you will ever taste. Why would I need to mess around with that? Chefs aren't geniuses, we are cooks,' he says, 'but Ferran deserves the mantle. A place like El Bulli will never happen again. It is impossible. One man's vision of what you could do with food.'
Back in Spain, Adrià's relentless assault on my taste buds has driven me from the table overwhelmed, succumbed, surrendered, my hands and legs shaking, and we are 'only' around 30 courses in. I have licked my plate of 'gazpacho' and 'ajo blanco', oblivious to my more reserved, more refined companions. I have tasted five of Geoffroy's dazzling Dom Pérignons, but I need respite before the two hare dishes, the 'game meat cappuccino', the 'blood', the 'pond', the donuts, the other desserts and the 'box'.
I wander into the kitchen, where Observer photographer Howard Sooley is seven hours into his shoot – the first time Adrià has let anyone photograph behind the scenes during service.
Sooley used to work for US Vogue, and I watch as he slides between the chefs as they change direction like a shoal of silvery fish. And it strikes me: this is almost cooking as couture, backstage behind the catwalk as fantastical creations are pinned and primped into shape. I take in the dozens of tiny saucepans, the syringe-spiked dishes, a group of six young chefs intently plating up. All the cooks appear choreographed like a beautiful, complicated machine. Nothing is taken for granted, nothing is unconsidered.
There is true art in the artifice here, an underlying integrity to every technique. But somehow my celebrity-spiked supper has conjured up memories and emotions as much as the expected exquisite tastes. The plate-licked gazpacho is saturated with Spanish holidays. The peas take me back to podding on the porch with my mother in her yellow summer dress. The smell of the hare stock I will carry with me for ever.
At the perimeter of the kitchen, Ferran Adrià paces in silence, quietly observing. The general, seemingly unemotional, almost uninvolved. But watching. His eye seeing everything, like an eagle hanging high in the sky to catch the movement of every blade of grass.
He turns, sees me, too, standing there with lost eyes, and comes over. 'Magic,' he smiles softly, and he is right. As Jason Atherton says: 'The guy is a legend, simple as that. We won't see his like again in our lifetime.' ", review2:" I remember reading about El Bulli four or five years ago in the French newspaper Le Monde. I remember the yearning, and I remember the pang that followed closely: considering the small number of guests that the restaurant could accommodate each season, the dream seemed out of reach. But a few years later, I learned from a well-informed friend that getting a reservation was a bit like playing the lottery: the odds were low, but it didn’t cost much to try (see below).
And so I played, I won, and this is how Maxence and I found ourselves flying to Barcelona last weekend with three of our friends. My state of mind was a mix of excitement and circumspection: few restaurants have gotten as much press as this one, and I knew that the actual experience could fall short of my expectations. Fortunately, there was no need to brace myself for disappointment. The evening that we spent at El Bulli was every bit as extraordinary, surreal, and more important, joyful, as I’d hoped it to be.
We arrived at the restaurant in early evening, after a short curvy ride up and down the mountain road that leads to Cala Montjoi, and offers a striking view out to sea. A tiny parking lot, a small (and a bit scruffy) beach, a handsome tiled-roof house — we walked up the stairs and were greeted by the staff, who gave us a short tour of the kitchen and led us to our table by the window, nicely isolated from the rest of the room: the arrival of each dish offers a bit of a dramatic thrill, so we were happy not to get any spoilers from the other tables.
The tasting menu, which changes slightly every day, unfolds in three acts and thirty-five dishes: small snacks that you eat with your fingers, larger-sized tapas to be eaten with a fork and spoon (no knife, ever), and desserts. It is a fast-paced dining rollercoaster, with explosive flavors and textural surprises that await you at every turn — it is thus a good idea to take a break on the terrace every now and then. Each dish, or group of dishes, is brought to the table by a small squadron of waiters dressed in black, and while you are busy taking pictures of the new UFO that has just landed, the head waiter explains what it is (in our case, in excellent French), and how to eat it: start with this end or that, gobble it up in just one bite, or hurry before it melts.
There were recurring themes within the meal — seaweed, seeds, Parmesan, Thai flavors, clementine, peach, the cotton candy texture, and Adrià’s famous esferificación technique, in which liquids are trapped in a thin alginate casing that bursts open on your tongue. Not everything was successful, and not everything sent shivers of pure pleasure down your spine: some of the flavors were quite strong, and it took stamina to take them all in with fresh taste buds. But every single item managed to amaze and entertain, making the whole experience quite dazzling, both on an intellectual and sensory level.
We gave carte blanche to the sommelier, who selected five different wines for us — let us take a moment to consider how challenging it is to come up with pairings for such a wacky menu. In order of appearance, we tasted a Cava (Brut Nature Gran Reserva 2002 / Cava Augusti Torello), a white wine from Penedès (Xarel.lo Pairal 2003 / Can Ràfols dels Caus), a white Rioja (Allende 2004 / Finca Allende), a red Burgundy (Volnay Les Roncerets 1998 / Nicolas-Rossignol), and a sweet wine from Montilla-Moriles (PX Reserva 1998 / Alvear).
It took us six hours to go through the entire meal — from 8pm to 2am — but we were in such a state of elation that it was hard to tell if it had been two minutes or two days since we had first sat down. I would like to stress here how pleased we were with the service: the ballet of dishes coming and going was perfectly choreographed, and the waitstaff was exceptionally warm and attentive, making us feel as if we were the only guests in the restaurant.
So, do I think that El Bulli is the best restaurant in the world? First of all, I’m sure I’m not the only one to whom the idea of one single “best restaurant in the world” seems ludicrous: depending on my mood, my appetite, and who I’m with, the best restaurant in the world can be the pizza place down the street or a farm-inn on top of a hill, just as much as any three-star on the planet. But dining at El Bulli is certainly a one-of-a-kind experience, and I wish it upon anyone who’s passionate about food, who has broad tastes, who is tickled by the discovery of new flavors, and who is happy to be whisked away on a flying carpet driven by a mad scientist, even if the ride leaves him a bit dizzy.
How much does dinner cost? The tasting menu is 165€. Add wine, water, and coffee, and you’re looking at roughly 220€ per guest — a reasonable price compared to other three-star restaurants.

That's because eating at Alinea, which involves around 20 courses over about three hours, is more than simply dinner-it's culinary theater. Perhaps it could qualify for a Tony Award along with its Michelin stars, because you're even invited backstage afterwards to meet the talented protagonists in the kitchen. Alinea provides such a vivid, visceral experience, that you'll even forget about the somewhat painful and entirely inhospitable booking procedure. Neophytes have nothing to fear here as there's a veritable army of charming, clued-up helpers and servers to guide you effortlessly through each and every dish. And guidance is certainly needed because the only menu you'll see is the one presented to you like an award certificate as you leave. The cooking is strikingly original and very clever. It can surprise but it can also challenge; at times dishes can be playful or even whimsical. But underpinning all those clever techniques and all those dazzling arrangements and quite striking presentations is an inherent understanding of flavor-and this is what gives the cooking such great depth.
